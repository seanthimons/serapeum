### 🚧 v3.0 Ragnar RAG Overhaul (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Replace the legacy embedding/retrieval system with ragnar as the sole RAG backend, using per-notebook vector stores for clean isolation and optimal retrieval.

- [x] **Phase 20: Foundation & Connection Safety** - Per-notebook path helpers, metadata encoding, version checks, connection lifecycle (completed 2026-02-16)
- [x] **Phase 21: Store Lifecycle** - Automatic creation on first content, deletion cascade, rebuild capability, corruption recovery (completed 2026-02-17)
- [x] **Phase 22: Module Migration** - Switch document and search notebook modules to per-notebook ragnar stores (completed 2026-02-17)
- [ ] **Phase 23: Legacy Code Removal** - Remove ragnar_available conditionals, cosine similarity fallback, replace digest::digest() with rlang::hash()
- [ ] **Phase 24: Integration Testing & Cleanup** - End-to-end tests, shared store deletion

## Phase Details

### Phase 20: Foundation & Connection Safety
**Goal**: Establish deterministic path construction, metadata encoding, and connection lifecycle patterns for per-notebook ragnar stores
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v3.0)
**Requirements**: FNDTN-01, FNDTN-02, FNDTN-03, TEST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every notebook ID produces a deterministic path `data/ragnar/{notebook_id}.duckdb` without database lookups
  2. Section_hint metadata survives round-trip through ragnar's origin field encoding/decoding
  3. App detects incompatible ragnar versions on startup and warns user before attempting store operations
  4. Ragnar store connections automatically close on error, session end, and context exit via explicit cleanup hooks
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 20-01-PLAN.md — Path helper + metadata encode/decode (TDD)
- [ ] 20-02-PLAN.md — Version check, connection lifecycle, directory creation

### Phase 21: Store Lifecycle
**Goal**: Per-notebook ragnar stores are created automatically on first content, deleted when notebook is deleted, and can be rebuilt on corruption
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: LIFE-01, LIFE-02, LIFE-03, LIFE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ensure_ragnar_store() creates a new store on first call and connects to existing store on subsequent calls (LIFE-01 mechanism; wiring into modules in Phase 22)
  2. User deletes notebook and its ragnar store file is removed from disk after DB records are deleted
  3. User sees "Rebuild Index" modal when ragnar store is corrupted, can rebuild with progress feedback
  4. Orphan cleanup button in settings identifies and removes store files with no matching notebook
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 21-01-PLAN.md — Core lifecycle functions, deletion cascade, orphan cleanup
- [ ] 21-02-PLAN.md — Corruption detection, integrity check on open, rebuild with progress

### Phase 22: Module Migration
**Goal**: Document and search notebook modules use per-notebook ragnar stores for all RAG operations, eliminating cross-notebook pollution
**Depends on**: Phase 21
**Requirements**: (Implicit - enables per-notebook isolation)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User uploads PDF to notebook A and chats with it, sees only chunks from notebook A in retrieval results
  2. User switches to notebook B and retrieval automatically uses notebook B's store without filtering
  3. User embeds abstracts in search notebook and section-targeted synthesis retrieves correct chunks using encoded section_hint
  4. User can work with multiple notebooks simultaneously without cross-contamination of retrieval results
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md — Backend wiring: search_chunks_hybrid per-notebook path, chunk deletion + sentinel helpers, shared store cleanup
- [ ] 22-02-PLAN.md — Document notebook migration: re-index prompt, rag_ready state, per-notebook upload wiring
- [ ] 22-03-PLAN.md — Search notebook migration: re-index prompt, embed handler rewire, chunk deletion on paper removal

### Phase 23: Legacy Code Removal
**Goal**: Remove all legacy embedding and retrieval code paths, making ragnar the sole RAG backend
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Requirements**: LEGC-01, LEGC-02, LEGC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No ragnar_available() conditional branches remain in codebase - all RAG paths use ragnar directly
  2. No manual get_embeddings() calls or cosine similarity functions exist in pdf.R or rag.R
  3. digest::digest() replaced by rlang::hash() for chunk hashing; no legacy digest::digest() usage remains
  4. Codebase search for "ragnar_available", "cosine_similarity", "use_ragnar" returns zero results in R files; get_embeddings has exactly 2 results (definition in api_openrouter.R + usage in _ragnar.R embed closure)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 23-01-PLAN.md — Single-sweep legacy code removal across 6 production files + 2 test files, digest-to-rlang migration

### Phase 24: Integration Testing & Cleanup
**Goal**: End-to-end integration tests validate per-notebook workflow, shared store is deleted after migration
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Requirements**: TEST-01, LEGC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Integration test creates notebook, uploads PDF, embeds chunks, queries ragnar store, and verifies correct retrieval - all passing
  2. Integration test validates section_hint encoding survives round-trip from upload through retrieval
  3. Shared ragnar store file `data/serapeum.ragnar.duckdb` no longer exists on disk after app startup detects per-notebook stores
  4. App startup checks for legacy shared store, logs deletion, and proceeds normally without errors
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01: TBD
