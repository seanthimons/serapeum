## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 Quality of Life milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Cost Tracking

- **RECSV-01**: Recursive abstract searching (#11)

### Document Understanding

- **CONC-01**: Conclusion synthesis into future directions (#27)
- **IMG-01**: PDF image pipeline — extraction through to slides (#44)

### Infrastructure

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Audio overview (#22) | Experimental, low priority |
| Semantic Scholar integration (#21) | OpenAlex sufficient for current needs |
| Full OpenAlex corpus ingestion (#41) | Moonshot — requires significant infrastructure |
| DuckDB native vector search (#42) | Moonshot — current embedding approach works |
| Demo mode (#30) | Low impact, defer |
