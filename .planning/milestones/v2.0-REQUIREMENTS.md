# Requirements: Serapeum v1.2 Stabilization

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Researchers can efficiently discover relevant academic papers through seed papers, assisted query building, and topic exploration

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for the stabilization release. Bug fixes and UI polish.

### Bug Fixes

- [ ] **BUGF-01**: OpenAlex topic searches succeed without 401 errors - root cause identified and fixed (#59)
- [ ] **BUGF-02**: User sees friendly, actionable error messages for OpenAlex and OpenRouter API failures instead of raw HTTP status codes (#65)
- [ ] **BUGF-03**: Navigating away from search notebook and returning does not retrigger the OpenAlex request (#68)

### UI Polish

- [ ] **UIPX-01**: User can collapse/expand the Journal Quality filter card to save vertical space in the search notebook right panel (#73)
- [ ] **UIPX-02**: Block journal badge aligns vertically with other inline badges (year, type, access, journal) in abstract detail view (#72)

## Future Requirements

### Deferred from v1.1

- **BULK-01**: Bulk DOI/.bib import for batch paper ingestion (#24)

### Deferred from v1.2

(None - all scoped items included)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Citation network graph (#53) | Medium complexity, separate milestone |
| Recursive abstract searching (#11) | High complexity, future milestone |
| PDF image pipeline (#44) | Epic-level effort, future milestone |
| Local model support (#8) | Significant architecture change |
| DOI on abstract preview (#66) | Low priority, not a bug |
| Export abstract to seeded search (#67) | New feature, not stabilization |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BUGF-01 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| BUGF-02 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| BUGF-03 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| UIPX-01 | Phase 10 | Pending |
