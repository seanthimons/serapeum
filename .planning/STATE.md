# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Researchers can efficiently discover relevant academic papers through seed papers, assisted query building, and topic exploration
**Current focus:** v2.0 Discovery Workflow & Output

## Current Position

Phase: 12 — Citation Network Visualization ✅
Plan: 02 of 02 complete (human-verified)
Status: Phase complete — human-verified
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Phase 12 verified and approved

Progress: v1.0 ✅ (9 plans) | v1.1 ✅ (6 plans) | v1.2 ✅ (2 plans) | v2.0 🔄 (4/8 plans shipped: phase 11 + 12) | Total: 22 plans shipped

## Performance Metrics

| v1.1 Quality of Life | 5-8 | 6 | 13 days |
| v1.2 Stabilization | 9-10 | 2 | 1 day |
| Phase 11 P01 | 4 | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 11 P02 | 1.5 | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

Recent decisions:
- [Phase 11]: Store DOI in bare format (10.xxxx/yyyy) not URL for BibTeX compatibility
- [Phase 11]: Nullable DOI column for backward compatibility with existing databases
- [Phase 12]: Manual cascade delete for DuckDB (doesn't support CASCADE on foreign keys)
- [Phase 12]: Store layout positions in network_nodes for instant reload without re-computing
- [Phase 12]: sqrt transform for citation counts to handle power-law distribution
- [Phase 12]: Plain author display strings instead of JSON serialization (avoids vapply errors)
- [Phase 12]: Cross-link discovery via referenced_works field (no extra API calls)
- [Phase 12]: Legend at top-right to avoid visNetwork nav button overlap
- [Phase 12]: Node cap floor lowered to 5, step to 5

### Pending Todos

- [#79](https://github.com/seanthimons/serapeum/issues/79): Tooltip overflow (tracked for next sprint)
- [#80](https://github.com/seanthimons/serapeum/issues/80): Progress modal with stop button
